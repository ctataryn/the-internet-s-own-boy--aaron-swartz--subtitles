The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz - 2014 - Subtitles
====================================================================

The goal
--------

We want to make this documentary accessible everywhere in the world even for people who does not speak English.

How
---

We completed the first English version! 
Thank you to all the contributors! :)

Translations can start without worring of too much rework.

If you want to start translating to a new language I recommend you to try transifex.com.
The first complete en_US version (51f59434eb) of the subtitles has been uploaded on Transifex:
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/the-internets-own-boy-subtitles/
As soon as a translation is completed I will add it here.

All subtitles are published here with CC0 license. 


IMPORTANT UPDATE:
Two days ago I discovered that there is a group that is doing something similar with a different tool:
http://www.amara.org/en/videos/5Mo4oAj1bxOb/info/the-internets-own-boy-the-story-of-aaron-swartz/

Their EN subtitles quality is a bit better even if sinchro is less precise.

I recommend you to try which tool you prefer.

If you also think that amara.org is better let me know your feedback.
I'll keep merging requests meanwhile, but if you think the other group is better I'm ok shutting down transifex.com and thinking about moving away from this repository and join forces.

Notes
-----

If there are sections where you're unsure just leave a [?] question mark in the subtitle, others can review and fix it.

It's easy to edit subtitles manually editing the .srt file. 
There are also many sutitle editor available you can try: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_editor. 
Aegisub is a good free, open source and cross-platform option: http://www.aegisub.org/
